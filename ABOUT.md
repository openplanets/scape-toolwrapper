# ToolWrapper

*Wrap preservation tools once, deploy them everywhere.*

What Is ToolWrapper?
--------------------
The ToolWrapper is a tool that allows wrapping existing digital preservation tools into bash scripts, Taverna Workflows, and Debian packages, to simplify tool description, invocation and packaging. ToolWrapper is used within the [SCAPE project](http://www.scape-project.eu) to allow easy finding of existing preservation components (i.e. characterisation, migration or quality assurance tools), easily using and combining them in preservation workflows using [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk), and easily deploying them in execution platforms using [Debian](https://www.debian.org) packages.

What Can ToolWrapper Do for Me?
-------------------------------

The ToolWrapper simplifies the execution of the following tasks:

1. **Tool description** - through the toolspec & optionally with the componentspec;
2. **Tool invocation** - through command-line wrapping;
3. **Artifacts generation** - associated to a tool invocation, e.g., Taverna workflow;
4. **Packaging** of all the generated artifacts for easier distribution and installation;
5. **Component upload** - a bash utility to upload Components (Taverna workflows with semantic annotations) to myExperiment website.

ToolWrapper Can Be Used By
--------------------------

* Preservation tool developers
* Preservation execution platform administrators
* Repository administrators
* Preservation experts
